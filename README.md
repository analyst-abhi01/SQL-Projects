# SQL Project Showcase ðŸ“‚

Welcome to my SQL Projects Showcase! This repository contains my key SQL project, where I have demonstrated my expertise in data querying, analysis, and insights generation using SQL. This project reflects my ability to work with structured data, write efficient SQL queries, and extract valuable business insights.

## About Me

Hi! I'm **Abhishek**, a passionate data analyst with strong SQL skills, currently pursuing a BBA in Finance and a B.Com in Accounting. I specialize in using SQL for data manipulation, querying, and analysis. This repository highlights one of my significant SQL projects, showcasing my journey in deriving insights from complex datasets.

## Project Overview

### 1. **Digital Music Store Analysis** ðŸŽ¶

In this project, I analyzed a digital music store database to extract insights into customer purchasing patterns, track popular music genres, and evaluate store performance. Key objectives and achievements in this project include:

- **Customer Analysis**: Segmented customers based on their buying behavior and preferences.
- **Sales Performance**: Queried sales data to identify top-performing albums, artists, and genres.
- **Revenue Insights**: Analyzed revenue distribution by region and genre, identifying trends and areas for improvement.
- **Operational Efficiency**: Assessed transaction data to uncover operational bottlenecks and improve store efficiency.

Through this project, I applied various SQL techniques, including:

- **Joins and Subqueries**: To connect and analyze multiple database tables.
- **Data Aggregation**: Using GROUP BY, SUM, COUNT to generate detailed reports.
- **Filtering and Sorting**: Leveraged WHERE and ORDER BY clauses for data extraction.
- **Window Functions**: Used window functions to rank top-selling albums and artists.

This project is also available on my portfolio: [http://www.analystabhishek.com/](http://www.analystabhishek.com/).

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Data Querying**: Efficient SQL queries to extract data insights.
- **Data Aggregation**: Using SQL functions to summarize sales and customer data.
- **Advanced SQL**: Joins, subqueries, window functions, and more.
- **Data Reporting**: Automated SQL reports for business decision-making.

## How to Use This Repository

- The project folder contains the **SQL scripts** used for querying and analysis.
- A **README** file explaining the projectâ€™s context, dataset, and key findings.
- Where applicable, additional **reports** or **visualizations** generated from the SQL queries.

## Future Plans

I am continuously improving my SQL skills and plan to:

- Dive deeper into advanced SQL techniques and performance optimization.
- Explore integrating SQL with **Python** for advanced data analysis.
- Work on **big data** projects, combining SQL with other tools.
